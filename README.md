WRML
================================

WRML, the Web Resource Modeling Language, is an open source software project (http://www.wrml.org) focused on providing REST API standards, frameworks, and tools to support the development of web-oriented, client-server applications.

Project Status
--------------

This code is old. As of Fall 2012, the latest WRML codebase has (temporarily) been moved to a private GitHub repo with development support from ESPN. Once it has been proven as a worthwhile solution, the intent is to bring the advanced codebase back here as the "official" home of the WRML source code.

WRML is under active development in a (private) repo here: https://github.com/espn/WRML

Once we have proved that WRML works well for our target use cases, the plan is to release it as OSS (Apache 2.0).

The OSS release is expected to happen sometime in 2013 and will include the WRML REST API server (WrmlServlet) along with the WRML core framework and tools that will enable REST APIs to be *designed* with UI tools and then loaded and run on top of your backend services (data stores).

In the meantime, the WRML web site (http://www.wrml.org) has more information about WRML and its approach to increasing our REST API development productivity.
