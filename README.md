WRML - Web Resource Modeling Language
====
WRML, pronounced like "Wormle", is an open source software project focused on providing standards, frameworks, and tools that support the development of web-oriented, client-server applications.

WRML is a schema-based modeling language that comes with a set of standards, tools, and frameworks. WRML can be thought of as a "Domain Specific Language" (DSL) for the Web and it's architectural style (known as REST). WRML shares some traits with traditional "Object/Relational Mapping" (ORM) frameworks; but WRML skews closer to Web-Oriented concepts (Schemas in place of Classes or Tables). 

WRML.org is the home of the WRML Project, an open source endeavor promoting the development of WRML-based standards, tools, and frameworks.

The most comprehensive overview "README" of WRML is located here: http://www.wrml.org/wrml.pdf

NOTE: This code is old. As of Fall 2012, the latest WRML codebase has (temporarily) been moved to a private GitHub repo with development support from ESPN. Once it has been proven as a worthwhile solution, the intent is to bring the advanced codebase back here as the "official" home of the WRML source code.

For those with access, the temporary (private) repo location is here: https://github.com/espn/WRML
