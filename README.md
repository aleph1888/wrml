WRML - Web Resource Modeling Language
====

NOTE: The WRML codebase has (temporarily) been moved to a private GitHub repo with development support from ESPN. Once it has been proven as a worthwhile solution, the intent is to bring the advanced codebase back here as the "official" home of the WRML source code.

The temporary (private) repo location is here: https://github.com/espn/WRML
