/**
 <p>
 WRML, the Web Resource Modeling Language (top level Java package). 
 </p>

 <p>
 WRML, pronounced like "Wormle", is an open source project focused on providing 
 standards, frameworks, and tools that support the development of web-oriented, client-server applications.
 </p>

 <p>
 WRML aims to help establish a uniform, programmatic interface for the Web, or at least a 
 <i>pseudo-standard</i> approach to designing uniform REST APIs. With widespread adoption of the WRML standards, 
 we can leverage a shared REST API design methodology and begin to fashion a uniformly programmable Web. 
 Uniform REST API design is not the ultimate goal, it is only a means to an end. The greatest benefit of a 
 standardized design and implementation methodology is the availability of helpful frameworks and tools that 
 increase developer productivity by empowering programmers with a rich set of development tools and frameworks, 
 such as the graphical design tools provided by wrml.org, that we can leverage to design and develop REST APIs 
 and their clients.
